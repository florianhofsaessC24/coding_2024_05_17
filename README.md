**Task**

**Description:**

A fictitious company needs a simple application to manage content for its website. The content is provided by a headless CMS that offers a JSON API. Your task is to create a Node.js application to handle this.

**Requirements:**

**Backend:**

- Create a Node.js application that connects to a fictitious JSON API of a headless CMS - example responses from the API can be found in the fixtures folder.
- Implement a simple RESTful API in Node.js to provide this data.
- Structure your code properly and use appropriate Node.js modules for organizing and managing your application.
- Create APIs to support frontend features for pagination and filtering

**Frontend:**

- Create a simple frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks required) to display the data from your Node.js backend.
- Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily browse and view the content.
- Implement basic features like displaying content in lists or cards, filtering content by categories or tags, etc.

**Bonus Points (optional):**

- Implement simple authentication for the backend API to ensure that only authorized users can access the data.
- Improve the frontend by adding features like sorting, pagination, or searching to enhance the user experience.
- Implement a way for users to add or edit content through the frontend and send these changes to the backend.

**Notes:**

- The choice of frameworks is up to you!
- Prioritize independently
